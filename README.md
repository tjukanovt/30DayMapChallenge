# #30DayMapChallenge 🌎🌏🌎

![Themes for the maps. See more below.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge/master/images/30dmpc_2021.png)

## Daily social mapping project in November 2021
The official repository for #30DayMapChallenge, It is a daily mapping/cartography/data visualization challenge aimed at the spatial community.

The idea is to create (and publish) maps based on different themes on each day of the month using the hashtag `#30DayMapChallenge`, You can prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps from specific topics on specific days listed below. Just include a picture of the map when you post to Twitter with the hashtag. You don't have to sign up anywhere to participate. There are no restrictions on the tools, technologies or the data you use in your maps. Doing less than 30 is also fine (*doing all 30 is really hard!*). See the *Code of Conduct* at the bottom of the page.

Happy mapping!

## Themes 📆

*Daily challenges for 2021. As a new feature this year, three data challenges are introduced. On those days participant are encouraged to work on a common dataset. Find details on each category below.*

[See some inspiration from the great monochrome mapping competition](https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/monocarto-2019-winners/) (although those masterpieces took a bit more than a day to make, probably). |
| 10      | `10-11-2021` | **Raster**                           | Nothing stops you from doing almost all of the maps with raster data.

You can use Natural Earth as a part of your map or as the main source. You can download the data from a few different locations, but probably the easiest access is via [GitHub](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/tree/master/geojson) or the [Natural Earth homepage](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 14      | `14-11-2021` | **Map with a new tool**                 | As the whole #30DayMapChallenge is much about learning and experimenting, this day is dedicated to exploring new tools. See the list on this repo below or find something interesting yourself!                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Tools 🔨🔧

Because the challenge is aimed to be open for everyone, the tools listed here will be *open source tools*. That doesn't mean that **the challenge can be done with any kind of software** (or even without any software). Programming skills are not in any way a requirement to do the maps.

 - [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)
	 - A Free and Open Source Geographic Information System. A desktop software that allows you to read/write multiple data formats and output (mainly static) maps.
 - [Kepler](https://kepler.gl/)
	 - Open source geospatial analysis tool for large-scale data sets and for interactive maps.
 - [Aerialod](https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=aerialod)
	 - Not really a GIS tool, but can be used to create some stunning 3D visualizations
 - [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
	 - Free and open source 3D creation suite. Check out the BlenderGIS extension.
 - [R packages for geospatial](https://www.r-project.org/)
	 - [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html), [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [tmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html) and [rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/) to mention few examples.
 - [Mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org)
	 - Useful for geospatial data processing in the browser such as file format conversion, map projection, feature simplification, filtering, clipping, merging etc. Can also be run [locally from the command line](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper).
 - [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
	 - Declarative visualization specification including [cartographic output](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/#maps-geographic-displays). Specifications can be written directly in JSON or via program language interfaces such as [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) (Python) and [elm-vegalite](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vegalite/latest/VegaLite) (Elm). See, for example, this tutorial on using [OpenStreetMap with elm-vegalite](https://github.com/gicentre/litvis/blob/master/documents/tutorials/geoTutorials/openstreetmap.md)
 - [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/)
	 - More flexible but lower-level declarative visualization specification including cartographic output. Specifications can be written directly in JSON or via program language interfaces such [elm-vega](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vega/latest/).
 - [Litvis](https://github.com/gicentre/litvis)
	 - Literate Visualization notebook environment optimised for specifying visualizations and documenting the design process. While not specific to cartography, can be a useful environment for exploring cartographic design.
 - [Observable](https://observablehq.com)
	 - Reactive notebook environment for generation of visualization and cartographic output embedded in a textual narrative. Focus is on using [d3](https://d3js.org) for specifying visual output.

## Maps, stats and results
In 2020 more than 1000 people posted more than 7000 maps for the challenge on different platforms.

[#30DayMapChallenge bot by Haifeng Niu harvested comprehensive stats and maps from the challenge](https://github.com/hn303/30DayMapChallenge-Bot)   

Check the [30DayMapChallenge2020Metadata repository](https://github.com/dakvid/30DayMapChallenge2020Metadata) by David Friggens and give your contribution there. The aim there is to create an interactive gallery of the results.

## Code of Conduct
No matter if you are a GIS expert or never made a map before this challenge, everyone is welcome to participate,

But keep in mind a few things:
- All maps you publish have to be **your original work**. Don’t steal content from others.
- Give **credit to the original data source** whenever possible.
- The challenge is all about **creativity, openness and the joy of beautiful maps and cartography.** It is not a competition,
- **Don’t be an asshole**.

Inspiration for the challenge came from [Inktober](https://inktober.com/) and [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).
