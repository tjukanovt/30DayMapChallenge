Participants create maps based on these themes and share them on social media using the hashtag <code>#30DayMapChallenge</code>.</p> <p>Current year's themes will be announced closer to November.</p> <p>The idea is to create maps based around different themes each day of November using the hashtag <code>#30DayMapChallenge</code>. You can prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps on the dedicated days. Just include a picture of the map when you post to X/Instagram/Linkedin (or your preferred social media platforms) using the hashtag. You don't have to sign up anywhere to participate. There are no restrictions on the tools, technologies or the data you use in your maps. Doing less than 30 is also fine.

It is not a competition, - Be mindful in how you use AI tooling. If you generate all of your maps with generative AI tools, where's the fun?
