|------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01-11-2024 | Points                | 30DayMapChallenge classic: A map with points. Start the challenge with points. Show individual locations—anything from cities to trees or more abstract concepts. Simple, but a key part of the challenge. 📍                                    |
| 02-11-2024 | Lines                 | 30DayMapChallenge classic: A map with focus on lines. Roads, rivers, routes, or borders—this day is all about mapping connections and divisions. Another traditional way to keep things moving. 📏                                             |
| 03-11-2024 | Polygons              | 30DayMapChallenge classic: A map with polygons. Regions, countries, lakes—this day is for defined shapes that fill space. 🛑                                                                                                                     |
| 04-11-2024 | Hexagons              | Maps using hexagonal grids. Step away from square grids and try mapping with hexagons. A fun way to show density or spatial patterns. 🔷                                                                                                          |
| 05-11-2024 | A journey             | Map any journey. Personal or not. Trace a journey—this could be a daily commute, a long-distance trip, or something from history. The key is to map movement from one place to another. 🚶‍♂️✈️                                               |
| 06-11-2024 | Raster                | A map using raster data. Rasters are everywhere, but today’s focus is purely on grids and pixels—satellite imagery, heatmaps, or any continuous surface data. 🟦🟧                                                                             |
| 07-11-2024 | Vintage style         | Map something modern in a vintage aesthetic. Create a map that captures the look and feel of historical cartography but focuses on a contemporary topic. Use muted colors, fonts, and classic elements. 🕰️🗺️                                     |
| 08-11-2024 | Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) | Use data from HDX to map humanitarian topics. Explore the datasets from the Humanitarian Data Exchange, covering disaster response, health, population, and development. Map for social good. 🌍🚑                                     |
| 09-11-2024 | AI only               | This day is all about prompt engineering. Use AI tools like DALL-E, MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, or ChatGPT with geospatial capabilities to create a map based on AI-generated content. The challenge is to get the right prompt and critically assess the output—how well does AI capture or distort the map's intent? |
| 10-11-2024 | Pen & paper           | Draw a map by hand. Go analog and draw a map using pen and paper. The result doesn’t have to be perfect—it’s about the creative process. ✏️🗺️                                                                                                  |
| 11-11-2024 | Arctic                | Map the Arctic. Whether it’s ice coverage, wildlife habitats, or the effects of climate change, this day is all about mapping the cold extremes of the Arctic. ❄️🧊                                                                               |
| 12-11-2024 | Time and space        | Map something where time matters. Visualize change over time—urban growth, migration, or environmental shifts. Show the relationship between time and geography. ⏳🌍                                                                            |
| 13-11-2024 | A new tool            | Use a tool you’ve never tried before. The challenge has always been about trying new things. Use a tool, software, or drawing technique you’ve never worked with before. 🧪🔧                                                                    |

| 16-11-2024 | Choropleth            | Classic choropleth map. Use color to show data variation across regions. This simple but effective technique is a staple for showing thematic differences. 🎨                                                                                    |
| 17-11-2024 | Collaborative map     | Collaborate with others on a single map. For today’s challenge, team up! Whether you work with one person or several, the idea is to combine your efforts on a single map. 🤝🗺️                                                                 |
| 18-11-2024 | 3D                    | Map with depth. Add a third dimension to your map. Whether it’s visualizing elevation, buildings, or something more abstract, today’s about thinking beyond flat surfaces. 🎢🏔️                                                                |
| 19-11-2024 | Typography            | Map focused on typography. Let text and words do the heavy lifting today. Whether you’re focusing on place names, labeling, or using text to create shapes and patterns. ✍️🅰️                                                                    |

| 22-11-2024 | 2 colours             | Create a map using only 2 colors. No gradients or shading—just two flat colors. This restriction encourages creativity in design and forces you to think about how to clearly convey your message with minimal color.                             |
| 23-11-2024 | Memory                | Map based on memory. Create a map of a place you remember—hometown, favorite destination, or somewhere meaningful. It doesn’t need to be perfectly accurate, just how you recall it. 💭🗺️                                                        |

Whether it's focusing on the classic Mercator, the Peters projection, or a more obscure one like the Waterman Butterfly, today is about playing with how we represent the round Earth on flat surfaces.                   |
| 27-11-2024 | Micromapping          | Map something small and precise. Zoom in and map a small area in high detail. It could be a single building, a street corner, or a tiny plot of land. Focus on accuracy at a small scale. 🧐🔍                                                     |

| 30-11-2024 | The final map         | The final challenge—your choice! Revisit a technique from earlier in the month, refine an idea, or try something completely new. End the challenge on a high note with a map that showcases your creativity, growth, or just pure fun! 🎉🌐        |


The idea is to create maps based around different themes each day of November using the hashtag `#30DayMapChallenge`. You can prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps on the dedicated days. Just include a picture of the map when you post to X/Instagram/Linkedin (or your preferred social media platforms) using the hashtag. You don't have to sign up anywhere to participate. There are no restrictions on the tools, technologies or the data you use in your maps. Doing less than 30 is also fine. See the *Code of Conduct* at the bottom of the page.

## Code of Conduct
No matter if you are a GIS expert or never made a map before this challenge, everyone is welcome to participate,

But keep in mind a few things:
- All maps you publish have to be **your original work**. Don’t steal content from others.
- Give **credit to the original data source** whenever possible.
- The challenge is all about **creativity, openness and the joy of beautiful maps and cartography.** It is not a competition,
- Be mindful in how you use AI tooling. If you generate all of your maps with generative AI tools, where's the fun? This is not a prompt engineering challenge. 
- **Don’t be an asshole**. Don’t harass or steal from others.

Inspiration for the challenge came from [Inktober](https://inktober.com/) and [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).
